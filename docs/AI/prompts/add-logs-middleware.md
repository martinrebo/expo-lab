# ðŸ§  AI Prompt: Create a Logger for Node.js Express Using Winston + Morgan

Act as an expert Node.js backend developer. Use Best Practices. Domain Driven Design. Easy To Change. Add documentation Readme.logger.md. 

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Generate code that:

- âœ… Creates a **centralized logger** using **Winston**
- âœ… Integrates **Morgan** to log HTTP requests
- âœ… Sends Morgan logs through Winston
- âœ… Writes logs to:
  - Dev mode: choose a library for log-viewer with UI in a dedicated Port (in development)
  - Files (in all environments) (In the future we will choose a cloud service)
- âœ… Supports **log levels** (`info`, `error`, `debug`, etc.)
- âœ… Structures the logger in a separate `common/utils/logger.ts` file
- âœ… Apply the logger in the middleware  `common/middleware//logger.middleware.ts` file
- âœ… Uses environment detection (`process.env.NODE_ENV`)
- âœ… Prevents sensitive info from being logged
- âœ… Logs errors with stack traces
- âœ… In dev mode see full body, tokens. 

## ðŸ“¦ Additional Requirements

- Use TypeScript
- Use file logs:
  - `logs/combined.log`
  - `logs/error.log`
- Use `morgan("combined")` format
- Pipe Morgan logs to Winston via a custom stream
- Export the logger for use in other files

## ðŸ’¡ Optional (Advanced)

If possible, show how to:

- Add a transport for Easy to Change external logging (like AWS, GCP, CloudWatch, BetterTrace etc...)
- Highlight differences between dev/prod logging formats
- In Production environment Mask sensitive data from request body or query strings
