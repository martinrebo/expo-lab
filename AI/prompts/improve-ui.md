Objective: Improve the UI/UX of this web and mobile app built with React Native + Expo.

Context:
	•	The project is a React Native app using Expo SDK 53.
	•	The current UI is functional but basic; we want to make it more visually appealing, responsive, and intuitive.
	•	Design inspiration: clean, modern, mobile-friendly design (similar to apps like Notion, Calm, or Duolingo). Use an Easy to Change palette of colors.

Tasks:
	1.	Refactor existing UI components for better visual structure and alignment.
	2.	Add consistent styling using StyleSheet.create().
	3.	Use custom styled components to replace raw View, Text, and Button with Themed polished equivalents.
	4.	Improve spacing, padding, margins, and layout responsiveness across different screen sizes. Mobile and Desktop.  
	5.	Suggest UI enhancements like:
	•	Better button styles and states (hover, disabled, loading)
	•	Typography improvements (font size, weight, hierarchy)
	•	Create a Theming easy to change to add new themes(light/dark/brand1/brand2... )
	•	Adding icons (use react-native-vector-icons or similar)
	•	Animate transitions or interactions using react-native-reanimated or framer-motion
    •	Functional Header and Footer Menus for Desktop and mobile. 

Constraints:
	•	Keep the changes modular and reusable (use components, not inline styles). Create Themes folder. 
	•	Ensure compatibility with Expo and minimal setup changes.
	•	Avoid introducing too many new dependencies unless necessary.
    •	Take into account platform specific issues. OS, Android, Web. Also consider Mobile vs Desktop design differences.
